IMPLICITLY DEFINED SUBJECT

If the first argument to the outermost example group is a class
an instance of that class is exposed to each example via the subject method

While the examples below demonstrate how subject can be used as a user-facing concept
we recommend that you reserver it for support of custom matcher and/or extension libraries that hide its from example
