ONE-LINER SYNTAX

RSpec supports a one-liner syntax for setting an expectation on the subject.
RSpec will give the examples a doc string that is auto-generated from the matcher used in the example.
This is designed specificially to help avoid duplication in situations
where the doc string and matcher used in the example mirror each other exactly.
When used excessively, it can produce documemtation output
that does not read well or contribute to understanding the object you are describing.

This comes in two flavors:
+ is_expected is defined simply as expect(subject)
and is designed for when you are using rspec-expectations with its newer expect-based syntax
+ should was designed back when rspec-expectation only had a should-based-syntax.
However, it continues to be available and work even if the :should syntax is disabled 
(since that merely removes Object#should but this is RSpec::Core::ExampleGroup#should)

Notes:
+ This feature is only available when using rspec-expectations
+ Examples defined using this one-liner syntax cannot be directly selected from the comamnd line using the --exammple option
+ The one-liner syntax only works with non-block expectations
