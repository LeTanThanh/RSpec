EXPLICIT SUBJECT

Use subject in the group scope to explicitly define the value that is returned by the subject method in the example scope.

Note that while the examples below demonstrate how the subject helper can be ised as a user-facing concept
we recommended that you reserve it for support os custom matcher and/or extension libraries that hide its use from examples.

A named subject improves on the explicitly subject by assigning it a contextually semantic name.
Since a named subject is an explicitly subject,
it still defines the value that is returned by the subject method in th example scope.
However, it defines an addtional helper method with the provided name.
This helper methods is memoized.
The value is cached across multiple calls in the same example but not across examples.

We recommended using the named helper method over subject in the examples
