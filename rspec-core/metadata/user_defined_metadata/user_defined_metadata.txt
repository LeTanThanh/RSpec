USER DEFINED METADATA

You can attach user-defined metadata to any example group or example/
Pass a hash as the last argument(before the block) to describe, context or it.
RSpec supports many configuration options that apply only to certain examples or groups based on the metadata.

Metadata defined on an example group is available (and can be overriden) by any sub-group
or from any example in that group or a sub-group.

In addtion, you can specify metadata using just symbols.
Each symbol passes as an arguments to describe, context or it will be a key in the metadata hash,
with a corresponding value of true.
