LET AND LET!

Use let to define a memoized helper method.
The value will be cached across multiple calls in the same example but not across examples.

Note that let is lazy evaluated: 
it is not evaluated until the first time method it defines is invoked.
You can use let! to force the method's invocation before each example.

By default, let is threadsafe, 
but you can configure it not to be by disabling config.threadsafe
which let perform a bit faster.
