AROUND HOOKS

Around hooks receive the example as a block agrument,extended to bahaves as a proc.
This lets you define code that should be executed before and after the example.
Ofcourse, you can do the same thing with before and after hooks: and it's often cleaner to do so.

Where around hooks shine is when you want to run an example within a block
For instance, if your database library offers a transaction method that receives a block,
you can use an around hook to cleanly open and close transaction around the example

WARNING: around hooks do not share state with the example the before and after hook do.
This mean that you cannot share instance variables between around hooks and examples

WARNING: Mock frameworks are set up and torn down within the context of running the example.
You cannot interact with them directly in a around hooks.
