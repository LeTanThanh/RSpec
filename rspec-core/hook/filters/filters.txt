FILTERS

before, after, and around hooks defined in the block passed to RSpec.configure 
can be constrained to specify examples and/or groups using metadata as a filter.

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before(:example, type: :model) do
  end
end

RSpec.describe "something", type: :model do
end

Note that filtered :context hooks will still be applied to individual examples with matching metadata
in effect, every example has s singleton example group containing just the one example group

You can also specify metadata using only symbols
